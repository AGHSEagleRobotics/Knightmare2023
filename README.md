# Knightmare2023
Knightmare was our 2016 (_FIRST_ Stronghold) competition robot.
That year, Knightmare took quite a beating but held up well.

Since then, Knightmare has served as a programming platform for learning and experimentation, and the drive base has served as a prototype platform early in build season.

And now, Knightmare is being transformed into a robot that will throw out the first pitch at a SLO Blues baseball game.
